I'm a Mason Now

You used to laugh at me when I drove a Shriner's car
You said it'd never fly, that I'd never get this far
I always knew that I would make it someday
Now you'd be safer staying out of my way

Guess what, I'm a Mason now
And you'd better take care if you want to stay
On the good side
Of the guy who's
Got the secret handshake down

You think you're pretty bad with your pretty trophy wife
You drive a pretty car through your polo-trophy life
I got a robe and a pretty nice ring
You bet the Brotherhood's a wonderful thing

Guess what, I'm a Mason now
And you'd better take care if you want to stay
On the good side
Of the guy who's
Got the secret handshake down

Should we talk about the governments that I control?
Should we talk about the hands of fate, the dice they roll?
The secret things you'll never see?
The secret man you'll never be?
The secret room that has no windows?

Too late to make amends, 'cause the wheel's in motion now
So get up off your knees, try to carry on somehow
You can't escape it, so you'd better not try
Now there's some friends of mine who'd like to say hi

Guess what, I'm a Mason now
And you'd better take care if you want to stay
On the good side
Of the guy who's
Got the secret handshake down
