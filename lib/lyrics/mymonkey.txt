My Monkey

My monkey gets busy sometimes
My monkey's got a lot of stuff he's gotta think about
My monkey gets tired sometimes
My monkey wishes he was something you could live without

Cause every monkey needs alone time
To eat bananas in the sunshine
It's feast or famine, it's a fine line
It doesn't mean my monkey doesn't love you

[My monkey butler Brian Dennehy screwed up again and he's sorry]
[My monkey he loves you My monkey loves you very much]
[My monkey says My monkey says]
[My monkey says he's sorry he's a monkey but he's got to be a monkey and there's nothing he can do]

My monkey gets frazzled sometimes
My monkey has an ulcer and a stressful time at work
My monkey gets bitter sometimes
My monkey's not the only one who's acting like a jerk

And while he doesn't like to name names
And he's not trying to assign blame
It's hard to focus on his own game
It doesn't mean my monkey doesn't love you

[My monkey butler Brian Dennehy screwed up again and he's sorry]
[My monkey he loves you My monkey loves you very much]
[My monkey says My monkey says]
[My monkey says he's sorry he's a monkey but he's got to be a monkey and there's nothing he can do]

My monkey gets angry sometimes
My monkey says a lot of things he doesn't really mean
My monkey gets lucky sometimes
My monkey thinks that you're the bestest girl he's ever seen

He says he'll stay with you for always
It doesn't matter what the job pays
Cause everybody has their bad days
It doesn't mean my monkey doesn't love you

[My monkey butler Brian Dennehy screwed up again and he's sorry]
[My monkey he loves you My monkey loves you very much]
[My monkey says My monkey says]
[My monkey says he's sorry he's a monkey but he's got to be a monkey and there's nothing he can do]

It doesn't mean my monkey doesn't love you
