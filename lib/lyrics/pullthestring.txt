Pull the String

Everybody knows you're onto something
And they all want in
They don't know about the bad news
You keep underneath your skin
And they think you've got it all figured out
But there's one thing you never talk about
It's a long time gone but it never went away

Pull the string
And this whole thing's coming down
Just pull the string

Smile pretty, the camera loves you
That's what they say
But there's a part of you that wishes
They would all just go away
Cause there's one small secret that's bugging you
It would break their hearts if they only knew
There's a world outside, you can feel it coming in

Pull the string
And this whole thing's coming down
Just pull the string

Call your lawyer, deny the rumors
But some lies are true
You can go there if you want to
When this ends is up to you
When your ten miles up and you're coming down
You don't feel a thing when you hit the ground
You just come apart and it's like you never were

Pull the string
And this whole thing's coming down
Just pull the string
