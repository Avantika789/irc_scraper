Make You Cry

I drove seven hours
All day to see you
The least that you could do is be at home
I wait outside the front door
I guess that I surprised us both
When you get home you're not alone
The way I thought you'd be
You introduce your friend
On some sunny day you're gonna fall for me
The way I fell for you
That's when I'm gonna make you cry

Ten bucks to buy you flowers
You say they're pretty
And you put them in a vase and say goodnight
Not quite what I had hoped for
Me, I've got nothing left but time
To try again and it's alright
Because I know you care
You just don't care for me
On some sunny day you're gonna fall for me
The way I fell for you
That's when I'm gonna make you cry

The love I hate
The hate I need
The pain that pulls me through
I can't wait
To watch you bleed
When your heart's broken too

I leave another message
That's two this morning
My fingers crossed I wait for you to call
I feel it getting closer
I'll wait forever, I know
Brick by brick I'm breaking down the wall
And when we're side by side
I'll build it up again
On some sunny day you're gonna fall for me
The way I fell for you
That's when I'm gonna make you cry

Gonna make you cry
Gonna make you cry
