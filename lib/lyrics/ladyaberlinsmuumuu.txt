Lady Aberlin's Muumuu

What angels found then lost again
So big and round, such rare and sensuous blue
Lady Aberlin's muumuu

A sweet repose, a place to hide
Where I suppose the world outside isn't true
Lady Aberlin's muumuuu

Can such a vision be real?
What do your flowers conceal?
Who knows what secret things your softer side has seen?
Shaped like a lady is shaped
Over her shoulders are draped
Stretches of heaven, Earth and all the worlds between

I wander somewhere in or out of make believe
And dream about the world I'm leaving for you
Lady Aberlin's muumuuu

And dream about the world I'm leaving for you
