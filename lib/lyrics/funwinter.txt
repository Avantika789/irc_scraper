Fun Winter

It's gonna be a fun fun winter now,
That I've got my wool socks on.
It's gonna be so exciting when,
It gets cold outside.

Your nose looks so damn cold but
my nose is so much colder.
If you can't see my breath,
why don't you stand just a little bit closer.

It's gonna be a fun fun winter now,
That you've got my wool socks on.
It's gonna be so exciting when,
It gets cold outside.
