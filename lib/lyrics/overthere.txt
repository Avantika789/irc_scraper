Over There

Take a boat, take a plane
Go to London, go to Spain
Take a train from Amsterdam to Monaco
Take a loved one if you think
They enjoy things that stink
Cause everything is different over there

When you're in Belgium you can eat
A lot of mayonnaise with your frites
And no one will say hey that's too much mayonnaise
Enjoy a German sausage hall
Eat an Italian meatball
But I hope you don't want a Twinkie
Because they don't have Hostess Twinkies over there

Over there you'll never feel at ease
Cause there's not much soap and there's too much cheese
And everyone wears clogs and rides on trains
Over there they'll make you regret that you ever
Saved their asses in World War II
Don't make me go over there

Cause I enjoy my freedom here
And I enjoy light-colored beer
I like to take showers
And I like to brush my teeth every day
Twice a day

They say that there's a place in France
Where the naked ladies dance
You can find it if you ask around
And there's a hole there in the wall
Where the men can see it all
The men don't care
Because they chew their underwear
And the underwear they chew costs a dollar ninety-two
Men go around with their ding dongs hanging down

Over there you'll never feel at ease
Cause there's not much soap and there's too much cheese
And everyone wears clogs and rides on trains
Over there they'll make you regret that you ever
Saved their asses in World War II
Don't make me go over there
No don't make me go over there
Don't make me go over there
