So Far So Good

Today's the day it gets better
This much I know
I'm gone, I'm getting out
And all you suckers can watch me go
And I don't know where I'm going yet
But it's somewhere quite a ways from here I'll bet

It's gonna be so far, so good (So far so far so far so good)
It's gonna be so far, so good (So far so far so far so good)
It's gonna be so far, so good (So far so far so far so good)

Too late to make it all better
This time it's real
No need for looking back
Don't have to talk about how we feel
And there's no-one we can pin this on
Cause you can't see that it's going till it's gone

But we got so far, so good (So far so far so far so good)
You know we got so far, so good (So far so far so far so good)
Yeah, we got so far, so good (So far so far so far so good)

Too bad, we could have done better
Next time we'll know
So sad, could have been
If only wishing could make it so
In a thousand years we'll meet again
And with the saddest smile you'll ask me how I've been

I'm gonna say so far, so good (So far so far so far so good)
I'm gonna say so far, so good (So far so far so far so good)
I'm gonna say so far, so good
