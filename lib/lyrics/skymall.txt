SkyMall

O'Hare is nice this time of year
I check my bags and find my seat and buy a beer and settle in
Such is my life here on the road
Now my seat back is up, tray table stowed and there's nothing to do
I gotta get myself through

So I am shopping in SkyMall
That five-mile-high mall
That always has just what I need
When I get to the gate and remember too late
I should have brought something to read
I'm OK, cause I know that I'm gonna shop SkyMall

I bought a pair of bonsai trees
I bought a big fake rock where I can hide my keys from everyone
And I imagine what all my friends would say
To see this lovable Santa dance and sway to my favorite songs
My favorite holiday songs

And I am shopping in SkyMall
That five-mile-high mall
That always has just what I need
When I get to the gate and remember too late
I should have brought something to read
I'm OK, cause I know that I'm gonna shop SkyMall

In Cleveland, I bought a replica of the sword that was broken
And then somewhere above Detroit some Successories that say "Lead with Vision"

I love you best when I'm away
And while I'm out here I look forward to the day when I come home
Cause there's something special waiting there
It's a whimsical statue of a bear that holds a bottle of wine
But please don't touch it, it's mine

Because I bought it in SkyMall
That five-mile-high mall
That always has just what I need
When I get to the gate and remember too late
I should have brought something to read
It's OK, cause I know that I'm gonna shop SkyMall
Cause I know that I'm gonna shop SkyMall
