Seahorse

He makes his way
And hopes someday
He'll find someone to love

He sees a girl
Her tail is curled
He swims up close to her

But he's a seahorse of course
Surely he knows
When you're a seahorse of course
That's how it goes

They meet, they mate
And things are great
But only for a while

He wakes at dawn
He sees she's gone
Somehow he's not surprised

Cause he's a seahorse of course
Surely he knows
When you're a seahorse of course
That's how it goes

And the waves above go up and down
The big fish circle all around
It's hard and cold and dark and mean
And he's so very small

Alone, afraid
His plans unmade
He helps his young survive

He makes his way
And hopes someday
He'll find someone to love

But he's a seahorse of course
Surely he knows
When you're a seahorse of course
That's how it goes
