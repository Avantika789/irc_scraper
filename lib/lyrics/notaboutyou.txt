Not About You

I haven't thought of you in fifteen days and today I still won't think of you
And when I call you up and you're not home well I might not even care
Every day gets better than the one before
Cause every day I know that I'm fine without you
But I don't think about it

This one is not about you
You can put that in your pipe and smoke it
This one is not about you
Baby, you can take that to the bank
Shove it up your big fat ass

Every time I ride past your house I forget it's you who's living there
Anyway I never see your face cause your window's up too high
And I saw you shopping at the grocery store
But I was far too busy with my cart to notice
You weren't looking at me

This one is not about you
You can put that in your pipe and smoke it
This one is not about you
Baby, you can take that to the bank
Shove it up your big fat ass

I saw that movie where the guy gets dumped when the girl goes off to find herself
But I think I may have missed the end - there was something in my eye
But it doesn't matter how it all turns out
Because I know that guy'll be fine without you
He shouldn't worry cause

This one is not about you
You can put that in your pipe and smoke it
This one is not about you
Baby, you can take that to the bank
Shove it up your big fat ass
