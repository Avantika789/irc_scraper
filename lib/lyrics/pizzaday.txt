Pizza Day

Did you notice something?
Did the world seem different since the moment you woke up today?
Everyone's excited,
Everyone feels happy in a way they can't explain today.

Doesn't matter who you are,
How your week has been so far,
Cause you know when lunch time comes, that everything will be OK

Hooray, pizza day
Hooray, pizza day

Some of us are lucky
Some of us have lots of friends, our tables will be full today
Some of us are lonely
Some of us have no one but it doesn't matter much today

Cause even if we don't belong,
We know another week is gone
And we know before too long, the whole damned thing will go away

Hooray, pizza day
Hooray, pizza day
