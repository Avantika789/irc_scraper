Better

Where did we go?
When was the moment that we broke in two?
I think I know
In fact I am sure I can blame it on you

I remember the first big surprise
The day you came home with your infrared eyes
I looked inside them, but all I could see
Were tiny reflections of me

But it's not me it's you, what you're turning into
Is some kind of something that I never knew
You used to be OK and I liked you that way
But I don't think that I like you better
No I don't think that I like you better

You started out small
Some gills and some wings and a few extra thumbs
Now you're thirteen feet tall
Even when you're asleep your machinery hums

And I'm tired of the evenings I spend
Making small talk with your new robot friends
And their stupid insistence on scanning my iris
When they know damn well who I am

And you look like the victim of a surgical crime
A little Darth Vader, a little Optimus Prime
You used to be OK and I liked you that way
But I don't think that I like you better
No I don't think that I like you better

So that's how it goes
Snap your mandibles once to say you understand
Now hold me close
Wait, now that's too close, you're crushing my hand

I can tell by that shrieking alarm
That your weapons systems are active and armed
Do me a favor and power them down
Just so we don't have a scene

And I wish it were different, but we're just not the same
At least we got someone we know we can blame
You used to be OK and I liked you that way
But I don't think that I like you better
No I don't think that I like you better
