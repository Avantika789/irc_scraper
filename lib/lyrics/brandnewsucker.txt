Brand New Sucker

Somebody put their feet up on the table
Somebody made a pretty bad call
Somebody's living in a pretty dream world
Somebody doesn't want to play ball

I'm not responsible for you, no more
You'll have to get your blood from somebody else now
I guess you better get a brand new sucker (New sucker, brand new sucker)
I guess you better get a brand new man (Brand new man)

Nobody goes a little bit crazy
Nobody gets a little bit dead
Nobody said that you could have it both ways
Nobody gave you nothing instead

I'm not responsible for you, no more
You'll have to get your blood from somebody else now
I guess you better get a brand new sucker (New sucker, brand new sucker)
I guess you better get a brand new man (Brand new man)

Everybody's gonna get it wrong sometimes
Everybody thought that you were OK
Everybody says you shouldn't be a stranger
But everybody likes it better that way

I'm not responsible for you, no more
You'll have to get your blood from somebody else now
I guess you better get a brand new sucker (New sucker, brand new sucker)
I guess you better get a brand new man (Brand new man)
