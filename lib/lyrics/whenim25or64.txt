When I'm 25 or 64

Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?

When I'm sixty-four?

When I get older losing my hair,
Many years from now.
Will you still be sending me a Valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?

(Twenty five or six to four)

Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?

(Twenty five or six to four)

When I'm sixty-four?

You'll be older too,
I could stay with you.

I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride.
Doing the garden, digging the weeds,
Who could ask for more?

(Twenty five or six to four)

Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?

(Twenty five or six to four)

When I'm sixty-four?

We shall scrimp and save
Vera, Chuck & Dave.

Send me a postcard, drop me a line,
Stating point of view.
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away.
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore.

(Twenty five or six to four)

Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?
