Womb with a View

We were so small when we met
I still remember, I'll never forget
Two button eyes and a tail
I couldn't tell female or male
I caught your eye through the glass
I waved with my flipper
You looked away kind of shy when you smiled, my world broke in two

From my womb with a view I can see everything
From my womb with a view I can see everything I need
I look at you
Because it's all I can do
From my womb with a view

Sometimes a whitecoat would pass
We'd share a look when they'd tap on the glass
I learned to wiggle my toes
You would laugh bubbles out your nose
Sometimes the lights would go off and there'd be a moment
Whenever I felt alone or afraid I always had you

From my womb with a view I can see everything
From my womb with a view I can see everything I need
I look at you
Because it's all I can do
From my womb with a view

What I am trying to say
I think today is a very big day
Something is calling me on
Maybe by morning I'll be gone
Maybe when we get outside we'll both still remember
Maybe someday we will meet on the street and I'll know it's you

From my womb with a view I can see everything
From my womb with a view I can see everything I need
I look at you
Because it's all I can do
From my womb with a view
