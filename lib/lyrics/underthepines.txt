Under the Pines

I agreed to host the show
That was how this whole thing started
How was I supposed to know
I would end up so broken hearted
We had one night
That's all it meant to you
Now I'm alone and I'm wishing I could stop
Thinking of you

I am in love
But it's only a fantasy
I'm in search of
That hairy creature who cared for me
Under the pines

Tried so hard to play it cool
Didn't want to overdo it
Wasn't I a lovesick fool
Sending you a big bag of suet
And a red rose?
I thought at least you'd call
Was I so wrong for expecting something more
Than nothing at all?

I am in love
But it's only a fantasy
I'm in search of
That hairy creature who cared for me
Under the pines

Close my eyes and I see you there
Musky smell of your matted hair
Our minds were one
But only for a moment

We're shooting "Atlantis" now
I'm staring at the big blue ocean
I wish you could be here somehow
I wish I really had no emotion
I'd be like you
Living from day to day
Crushing the heads and the hearts of smaller things
And going away

I am in love
But it's only a fantasy
I'm in search of
That hairy creature who cared for me
Under the pines
