Don't Talk to Strangers

When you were just a young girl and still in school
How come you never learned the golden rule?
Don't talk to strange men, don't be a fool
I'm hearing stories I don't think that that's cool

Why don't you tell me someone is loving you?
Cause you're my girl - some say it's no longer true
They say you're dating some slick continental dude
I'm begging you please

Don't talk to strangers
Baby don't you talk
Don't talk to strangers
You know he'll only use you up
Don't talk, don't talk, don't talk, don't talk to strangers

So tell me, how's life in the big city?
They say the competition's tough, baby that's a pity
When every guy's an actor every girl is pretty
I don't like what's getting back to me

So who's this Don Juan I've been hearing of?
Love hurts when only ones in love
Did you fall at first sight or did you need a shove?
I'm begging you please

Don't talk to strangers
Baby don't you talk
Don't talk to strangers
You know he'll only use you up
Don't talk, don't talk, don't talk, don't talk to strangers

Fais l'amour avec moi
What's he saying baby?
Viens dormir, mon amour
I asked you not to talk to him
Je t'aime donne moi ton coeur ce soir
I'm begging you please

Don't talk to strangers
Baby don't you talk
Don't talk to strangers
You know he'll only use you up
Don't talk, don't talk, don't talk to strangers
Don't talk, don't talk, don't talk to strangers
