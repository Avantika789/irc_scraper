Octopus

I still remember the words you said
They were hard enough to leave a mark
And now they echo inside my head
As I spiral down into the dark
I windmill upside down
Knowing you'll come at me again
And I feel your shadow pass above me

Octopus
Some kind of octopus
Tearing my shell apart
Letting the sea get in
You make my insides outside

I don't think I ever saw you blink
You were so controlled that no one knew
And by the time we all stopped to think
We were already too close to you
Now you keep coming by
Telling me it's not what I think
But I know a murder when I see one

Octopus
Some kind of octopus
Tearing my shell apart
Letting the sea get in
You make my insides outside

And far above me I can see the world
Receding slowly out of view
The sinking feeling that my worst mistake
Was all the time I spent with you

You said you're sorry, you said you'd try
But you never did, I guess we're done
Now bits of pieces of me float by
And I die in front of everyone
And you're already gone
Halfway to wherever you sleep
And you make me wish I never met you

Octopus
Some kind of octopus
Tearing my shell apart
Letting the sea get in
You make my insides outside
