Take Care of Me

I woke up with a headache
Slept too late and my coffee turned cold
Nobody got me my breakfast
My eyes are tired my body feels old
And no one seems to care
I'm looking at you when I say that

Why don't you take care of me?
Why don't you take care of me?
Why don't you take care of me?
When you know that I can't take care of myself?

I think this handle is broken
No one can fix it cause no one knows how
That's not the pen that I wanted
Come and look what you made me do now
I'm not surprised at all
I know how it goes
I get it

Why don't you take care of me?
Why don't you take care of me?
Why don't you take care of me?
When you know that I can't take care of myself at all?

I see you're busy with something
Go ahead and finish I swear it's alright
I'll just sit here in the dark then
With no one helping me turn on the light
And by the time you're done it's probably too late
To help me

Why don't you take care of me?
Why don't you take care of me?
Why don't you take care of me?
When you know that I can't take care of myself?
