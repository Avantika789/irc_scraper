Camp Bachelor Alma Mater

Hallowed shores of Sachsawanna shall we sing our praise to thee?
Ripe of flora, soft of fauna, rare of flow'r and tree (and flow'r and tree)
'Neath your fair and verdant bower beer and whiskey flow
Wives may come and wives may go
And the bachelor's life is all we know

Now a sandwich thick and tasty, now a cold Budweiser beer
Ev'ry torso pale and pasty, burning sun to fear (sun to fear)
Some will have their mettle tested, some will never know
Wives may come and wives may go
And the bachelor's life is all we know

Soon will end our time of leisure, our equipment black and blue
Waits at home domestic pleasure, ladies fair and true (and fair and true)
On our trembling hearts we beg you, bravery bestow
Wives may come and wives may go
And the bachelor's life is all we know
All we know
