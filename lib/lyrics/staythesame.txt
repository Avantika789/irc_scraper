Stay the Same

Why does everything have to change?
I wish it just all would stay the same
I don't get this comments game
Why does everything have to change?

Remember when I tuck you in?
I'd kiss your head, and then your chin
You'd fall asleep with a big, fat grin
Why does everything have to change?
And now we're in the adolescent years
Gangly legs and pointy ears
Growing up ain't nothing to fear
But some things are gonna change

Why does everything have to change?
I wish it just all would stay the same
I don't get this comments game
Why does everything have to change?

Why? why oh why?
Why?
