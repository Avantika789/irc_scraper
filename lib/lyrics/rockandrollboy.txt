Rock and Roll Boy

One, a two, a one, two, three, four
I want to be a rock star

When I was born I was just a young boy
Now I'm grown, I am a old boy
I live in this town, I love it (loves to live in this crazy, crazy town)
And there's nothing you can do to change it (nothing you can do to change it, nothing you can do to change it)

I'm a rock and roll boy (he is a rock and roll boy)
I love those rock and roll toys (he loves his rock and roll toys)
I'm a rock and roll boy (he is a rock and roll boy)
I love those rock and roll toys (he loves his rock and roll toys)

I come from a rock and roll town
And I know a kid named Mike Brown
If he ever comes to my town (if he ever comes to this crazy town)
I'm a gonna knock him down (I'ma gonna knock him down, I'ma gonna knoch him down)

I'm a rock and roll boy (he is a rock and roll boy)
I love those rock and roll toys (he loves his rock and roll toys)
I'm a rock and roll boy (he is a rock and roll boy)
I love those rock and roll toys (he loves his rock and roll toys)

When I was born I was just a young boy
Now I'm grown, I am a old boy
I live in this town, I love it (loves to live in this crazy, crazy town)
And there's nothing you can do to change it (nothing you can do to change it, nothing you can do to change it)


I'm a rock and roll boy (he is a rock and roll boy)
I love those rock and roll toys (he loves his rock and roll toys)
I'm a rock and roll boy (he is a rock and roll boy)
I love those rock and roll toys (he loves his rock and roll toys)

I'm a rock and roll rock and roll rock and roll boy
Oh yeah
This song goes out to my mom
I love you mom
