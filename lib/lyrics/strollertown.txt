Well it's early in the morning, full belly, clean bum
I got my cup of cheerios in case I want some
Jacket, hat, diaper bag, carried out the door
And I know where we're going cause we've been there before
There's a warm breeze blowing and it tickles my hair
And the sun shines down everybody is there
Every day is such a good day

Then we stop off at the corner and she pulls up next to me
A sporty crimson red MacLaren Techno XT
Me I'm sitting pretty in my Bugaboo Frog
Swivel wheel suspension so I sleep like a log
And my five point harness keeps me buckled in tight
And the XT's gunning as we wait for the light
And the wheels start spinning

My Bugaboo is heavy so we're taking off slow
But once we get her going she's got get up and go
The MacLaren's got a lead but I can see the slicks spin
My wheels are big and knobby I can feel them digging in
And we blow right by, now we're taking the lead
And the world's on fire with the wind and the speed
Every day is such a good day
