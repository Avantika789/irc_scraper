Just as Long as Me

It's a sad and awful story and the shorter folks don't care
I'm a man who's simply way too big to love
Picture her a tiny thing with tiny ribbons in her hair
Picture me a monster towering above

I don't care what color hair is growing on her head
She doesn't have to be a sight to see
It don't matter if she's fat or if she's good in bed
Just as long as she is just as long as me

Took an ad out in the paper with my picture and some prose
It said tall and lonely lover seeking same
Combed my hair and got a shave and bought a long stemmed thornless rose
When my picture ran my head was out of frame

I don't care what color hair is growing on her head
She doesn't have to be a sight to see
It don't matter if she's fat or if she's good in bed
Just as long as she is just as long as me

Every night I have a dream I'm on a mountain in the sky
And the air gets ever thinner as I climb
Then I see the gates of heaven, someone there has caught my eye
She is very tall and finally she is mine

I don't care what color hair is growing on her head
She doesn't have to be a sight to see
It don't matter if she's fat or if she's good in bed
Just as long as she is just as long as me
Just as long as she is just as long as me
