I Hate California

I hate California
There's something out there I just don't get
I know your friends out there must think I'm pretty strange
Because I dress as if the weather's gonna change
But it never does
I hate California

I hate California
The sun goes down the wrong side
Something in the water, maybe something in the sand
Maybe some west coast thing I'll never understand
Maybe just because
I hate California

I don't blame the Beach Boys
I don't blame Hollywood
I don't blame L.A.
Although I probably should
I don't blame the sky for its careless shade of blue
Lord knows I don't blame you
Lord knows I don't blame you

I hate California
One more beach day come and gone
And by the time you've finished gazing at the sea
3,000 miles away there's nothing left for me
If there ever was
I hate California

I don't blame the Beach Boys
I don't blame Hollywood
I don't blame L.A.
Although I probably should
I don't blame the sky for its careless shade of blue
Lord knows I don't blame you
Lord knows I don't blame you
Lord knows
I hate California
I hate California
I hate California
I hate California
