Resolutions

I will clean up my toys.
I will brush my teeth twice a day, and wash my hands after going to the bathroom and before eating.
I won't tease dogs - even friendly ones. I will avoid being bitten by keeping my fingers and face away from their mouths.
I will drink milk and water, and limit soda and fruit drinks.
I will apply sunscreen before I go outdoors. I will try to stay in the shade whenever possible and wear a hat and sunglasses.
I will try to find a sport (like basketball or soccer) or an activity (like playing tag, jumping rope, dancing or riding my bike) that I like and do it at least three times a week!
I will always wear a helmet when bicycling.
I will wear my seat belt every time I get in a car. I'll sit in the back seat and use a booster seat until I am tall enough to use a lap/shoulder seat belt.
I'll be nice to other kids. I'll be friendly to kids who need friends - like someone who is shy, or is new to my school.
I will take care of my body through physical activity and nutrition.
I will choose non-violent television shows and video games, and I will spend only one to two hours each day - at the most - on these activities.
I will wipe negative "self talk" (i.e. "I can't do it" or "I'm so dumb") out of my vocabulary.
When I feel angry or stressed out, I will take a break and find constructive ways to deal with the stress, such as exercising, reading, writing in a journal or discussing my problem with a parent or friend.
When faced with a difficult decision, I will talk with an adult about my choices.
I will be careful about whom I choose to date, and always treat the other person with respect and without coercion or violence.
I will eat at least one fruit and one vegetable every day.
