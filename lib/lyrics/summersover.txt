Summer's Over

Summer's over
You're going back to school
I'm staying here
Where else would I go?

Watch the leaves turn
Close up the swimming pool
Winter comes in
Sooner than you know

Nights get cold and the flowers let go
Bide their time under the snow
As they go down they say
Goodbye
Goodbye

Summer's over
Because it has to be
Just like before
Around and around

It's a circle
That's bringing you back to me
Stay where I am
I'm lost and found

When you go you come back again
Close the door, the cold's coming in
As I go down I say
Goodbye
Goodbye
