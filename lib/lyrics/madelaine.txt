Madelaine

If it doesn't kill you it'll make you stronger
But if it kills you you'll be dead
Use fluorescent bulbs, they'll probably last longer
But the buzzing sound might hurt your head
There's two ways of looking at your problem
Right or wrong, win or lose
Stand around and you'll never get the job done
All you have to do is choose

Madelaine, stay with me
Madelaine, leave me be
Madelaine, just tell me what you're gonna do
Madelaine, stay for more
Madelaine, use the door
Madelaine, I'm gonna leave it up to you

You could buy a dog to keep away the bad guys
But you'd have to walk him every day
You could open up a Chicken Kitchen franchise
Piss off the ASPCA
Either way, you better make your mind up
What is what, which is which
'Cause on the mound, they're ready with the windup
And you can't miss another pitch

Madelaine, stay with me
Madelaine, leave me be
Madelaine, just tell me what you're gonna do
Madelaine, stay for more
Madelaine, use the door
Madelaine, I'm gonna leave it up to you

So many tasties on your plate
What is a hungry girl to do?
Already it may be too late
I'm sick of cooking for you

You could tell me that it's getting past your bedtime
And that you have to say good night
You could tell me that you've had way too much red wine
You would probably be right
Either way, you better wash those glasses
You've got friends coming by
And besides, you're sick of making passes
Truth be told, so am I

Madelaine, stay with me
Madelaine, leave me be
Madelaine, just tell me what you're gonna do
Madelaine, stay for more
Madelaine, use the door
Madelaine, I'm gonna leave it up to you
