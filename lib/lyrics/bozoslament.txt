Bozo's Lament

I guess because my name is Bozo
I was destined to be a clown
But when I joined the traveling circus
I didn't think that it would bring me down
Make me angry like sniper in a tower
And every Saturday
I take off my nose and say never more

Pie in my face
Five days a workweek
It's in my face
Pie in my face
It sucks to be a clown

I should have been a lion tamer
Those guys get all the girls
In a cage in satin tights
In a mane of golden curls
Everybody loves the guy who lives in danger
But in the center ring
I'm safe from everything except for

Pie in my face
Five days a workweek
It's in my face
Pie in my face
It sucks to be a clown

The other night I dreamed of Arthur
Ex-human-cannonball
In the dream he asked the question
Do I fly or do I fall?
What's the difference
Either way he's still a dead man
And he's finally free
No longer has to be up on stage

Pie in my face
Five days a workweek
It's in my face
Pie in my face
It sucks to be a clown

Yeah it sucks to be a clown
Should have never been a clown
Cause it sucks to be a clown
