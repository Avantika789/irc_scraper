My Beige Bear

Taupe mouse, top hat on his head
Thinks he looks so good
Teal cat won't get off the bed
Even though she should
Indigo monkey's hiding underneath some other monkeys
Nobody even knows she's there

My beige bear doesn't care that he's old
My beige bear still has four paws to hold
When it's dark and it's cold
I reach out for my beige bear

Tan horse, dusty on the shelf
Too breakable to touch
Jade snake, happy by herself
Won't cuddle very much
Indigo monkey's making trouble when she should be sleeping
Everyone wants to go to bed

My beige bear doesn't care that he's old
My beige bear still has four paws to hold
When it's dark and it's cold
I reach out for my beige bear

Beige bear says that some monkeys might just be lonely
Beige bear says that no monkeys WANT to be bad
Beige bear says that some monkeys misbehave only
Because they're sad...

Mauve dog gets the bed just right
The pillow sinks down deep
Cream cow moos a soft goodnight
Now everyone's asleep
Indigo monkey's lying peacefully with arms around her
Next to a wise and kindly bear

My beige bear doesn't care that he's old
My beige bear still has four paws to hold
When it's dark and it's cold
I reach out for my beige bear
