Monkey Shines

When it gets bad do you believe it will get better?
Can you forget the big mistake?
Is it really living if you're living by the letter?
How many monkeys does it take, to change a lifetime?

(JoCo) Your monkey (JoCo) got a second chance, he thinks he'll take it
(JoCo) Your monkey (JoCo) knows that life is only what you make it
And once you learn how to love it's time to let it show
There's monkey shines wherever you go
