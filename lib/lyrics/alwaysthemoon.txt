Always the Moon

Before there ever was a you and me
The endless void of a dark, black sea
And a giant oyster, the mother of all things
And the oyster made a pearl
And the pearl became the world
And the world began to turn
And the sun began to burn
And then one day I met you and then fell in love
And you broke my tender heart
And so here we are

But there was always the moon
There was always the moon
There was always the moon
There was always the moon

Before there ever was a you and me
The slender branch of a gentle tree
And a big red fruit that hung low to the ground
And you picked it out of spite
And you took a careless bite
And the world was not the same
And we all know who to blame
So now when you think of me
Do think of when there was still a chance but it's over,
So here we are

But there was always the moon
There was always the moon
There was always the moon
There was always the moon

Remember when there was a you and me
When there was such a thing as gravity
And the tides came in and the tides went out again
But the water got too high
And the sun began to die
And I tried to make you stay
But the world pulled you away
And now there are darker longer colder nights
And the sun has gone for good
And so here we are

But there is always the moon
There is always the moon
There is always the moon
There is always the moon
