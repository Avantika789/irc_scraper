Bills, Bills, Bills

At first we started out real cool
Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things that you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling
And now you ask to use my car
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
And ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week

You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
He's the one to help me out
Instead of the scrub like you
Don't know what a man's about

Do you pay my bills?
Do you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
But I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Now you've been maxing out my card
Give me bad credit, buy me gifts with my own ends
Haven't paid the first bill
But instead you're headin' to the mall
Goin' on shopping sprees perpetrating
To your friends like you be ballin'
And now you use my cell phone
Callin' whoever that you think's at home
And then when the bill comes
All of a sudden you be acting dumb
You don't know where none of these calls come from
When your momma's number's here more than one

You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
He's the one to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you
Who don't know what a man's about

Do you pay my bills?
Do you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
But I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Do do do. Do you pay my bills?
Do do do. Do you pay my bills?
Do do do. Do you pay my bills?
Do do do. Do you pay my bills?
Do do do. Do you pay my bills?

Do you pay my bills?
Do you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
But I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
