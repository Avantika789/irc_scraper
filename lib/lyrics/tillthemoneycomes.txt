Till the Money Comes

We used to have such a good thing
But we were doomed from the start
It's a crying shame, the way things fall apart
I know you think that it's over
You're always telling me so
But I never was very good at letting go

I'm gonna love you till the money comes
It hasn't yet, so for now I'll stay
Till the money comes
Half of it's gonna be mine someday

You're always busy with something
Never a moment for me
Baby I don't mind, 'cause theres lot of good TV
You go to work every morning
I sit at home and drink gin
And I'll be right here on the day your ship comes in

I'm gonna love you till the money comes
It hasn't yet, so for now I'll stay
Till the money comes
Half of it's gonna be mine someday

Were you ever in love? So was I
Now I can't help thinking of the things that I will buy

I know that you've got potential
I know you're gonna come through
And since I don't work, I don't know what else to do
I'll move my things out of the bedroom
Blow up a bed in the den
When you've made me rich, I will learn to love again

I'm gonna love you till the money comes
It hasn't yet, so for now I'll stay
Till the money comes
Half of it's gonna be mine someday
