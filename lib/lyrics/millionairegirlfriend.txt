Millionaire Girlfriend

I will wait a lifetime if it takes that long
I know she's out there for I have heard her song
In dreams she sings to me
Her angel's voice a symphony
Is she in a garden or a meadow fair
Does the dappled sunlight shine ribbons in her hair?
Does she sit patiently smiling as she waits for me?

She's my millionaire girlfriend and she's my life
Once I finally find her I'll get permission from the wife
We will all live in our castle high
My beloved and my millionaire girlfriend and I

She's a stolen secret from a pirate's chest
I will wear an ascot and a suit that has a vest
And I will put it on as I watch gardener mow the lawn
She's a fairy princess from a song of old
I will have a toothbrush that is made of solid gold
And I will watch TV as my manservant flosses me

She's my millionaire girlfriend and she's my life
Once I finally find her I'll get permission from the wife
We will all live in our castle high
My beloved and my millionaire girlfriend and I

It does not matter to me if she's pretty
All that counts is what she's got at Citibank
Chase Manhattan or even Washington Mutual

When my search is ended I will cherish her
She will sign some papers, give me power of attorney
And what's hers will be mine in perpetuity

She's my millionaire girlfriend and she's my life
Once I finally find her I'll get permission from the wife
We will all live in our castle high
My beloved and my millionaire girlfriend and I
My beloved and my millionaire girlfriend and I
My beloved and my millionaire girlfriend and I
