Sibling Rivalry

Meet Joan and Jane
Joan and Jane are in Brooklyn New York
Jane and Joan are almost ready
Jane and Joan need a timeout
Jane and Joan have to start putting their ideas into action
Jane and Joan will face off
Jane and Joan will unleash their sibling rivalry
And then go their separate ways

Joan may have been nervous in the beginning
Jane seemed slightly sad
Joan poked around the same attic that Jane did
But found a completely different array of goodies
Joan went classic academia
Jane went totally retro
Jane was able to create the urban, Freudian elegance she was after
She'd better be careful

Jane has been up all night
Joan is in a little better shape
Jane would have loved to lounge downstairs
Joan tries to do a little spying on her sister's activities
Jane heads downstairs
Jane heads out to the mall
Joan is doing some creative camouflaging
Joan needs to find a solution
Joan is desperate
Jane really knows her stuff
She'd better be careful

At the last minute Jane spots a problem
Now Joan needs to tone it down
Joan schooled Jane on the court
So Jane has to get creative
Joan, on the other hand, has been inspired
Joan sets out to prove that she's still a kid at heart
All of Jane's projects are complete
Jane gets an unexpected call
She'd better be careful
