Soft Rocked By Me

I thought we'd start our evening off with a glass of cold ros√©
Then we can sit here on the couch just holding hands
And I'll say that you're beautiful
You might say I'm moving too fast
But I won't mind
Because I know in time

You will be soft rocked by me
Though it may take some time, I know eventually
You will be soft rocked by me
I use the passive voice to show how gentle I'll be
When I soft rock you
You will know it's true
That you've never been soft rocked 'til you've been soft rocked by me

I'll listen to the things you say about the way you feel
I'll smile an understanding smile when your boyfriend calls
Then you'll go, but you'll think of me
And one day you'll knock on my door
'Cause you want to be
Soft rocked by me

You will be soft rocked by me
Though it may take some time, I know eventually
You will be soft rocked by me
I use the passive voice to show how gentle I'll be
When I soft rock you
You will know it's true
That you've never been soft rocked 'til you've been soft rocked by me

Have you ever been in love with a man who's sensitive?
Have you ever spent the night with a man who cries?
Well that's me, I'm sensitive
And I cry, I'm crying right now
In a manly way
Because I know someday

You will be soft rocked by me
Though it may take some time, I know eventually
You will be soft rocked by me
I use the passive voice to show how gentle I'll be
When I soft rock you
You will know it's true
That you've never been soft rocked 'til you've been soft rocked by me
