Hindsight

Hindsight is 20-20
I shouldn't have drank that many
Hindsight is 20-20
Stop.

Little elevators are far too small for me
So I ride the big ones
It's not so fun unless you're OCD
And you like buttons

Hindsight is 20-20
I shouldn't have drank that many
Hindsight is 20-20
Stop.

Delta representative put me in a room with a stranger
He's no stranger anymore
When I peed I never closed the door

Hindsight is 20-20
I shouldn't have drank that many
Hindsight is 20-20
Stop.

Now pretend to speak French.
Je-bleugh-homme-rare.
Not literally.
