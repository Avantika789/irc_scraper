The Big Boom

It was 3 AM when I heard the sound
Stuck my head outside and I looked around
In the echo of car alarms ringing
The sense that something terrible had happened again
Hit the lights and put the TV on
And they said that Michigan was gone
Gone for good

Now I'm waiting for the big boom
And it knows where I'm gonna be
The big boom
I'm always getting closer to
The big boom
And it will catch up to me
The big boom

There are few safe places left today
Every night they come and take one away
Early on we believed we had a chance
Now there's no one who thinks that way anymore
And the infrastructure's coming down
And the government went underground
Gone for good

Now I'm waiting for the big boom
And it knows where I'm gonna be
The big boom
It's always getting closer to
The big boom
And it will catch up to me
The big boom

Only move by night; only move alone
Keep the fires low and stay off the phone
Keep on moving or stay right where you are
What's the difference; it's only a matter of time
And one by one the cities fall
And there won't be anything at all
Gone for good

And so I'm waiting for the big boom
And it knows where I'm gonna be
The big boom
It's always getting closer to
The big boom
And it will catch up to me
The big boom
