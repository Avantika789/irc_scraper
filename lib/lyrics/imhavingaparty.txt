I'm Having a Party

The time has come to celebrate my birthday
We just redid the basement, couch and all
You're all invited, even Mark Manelli
Just leave your coats and shoes in my front hall
We'll put on records and no one will dance
It's gonna be funny when Mark wets his pants

I'm having a party
Hey, you wanna sleep over?
We're gonna eat candy and get headaches in the basement
I'm having a party
Hey, you wanna sleep over?
We're gonna play spin the bottle till it's time to go to bed

My mom is making onion dip and Fritos
Her secret recipe that never fails
My brother says he won't come down and punch me
And we can drink his four-pack of Champales
Expect a visit from Fudgie the Whale
Ice cream and crunchies in his fudgy tail

I'm having a party
Hey, you wanna sleep over?
We're gonna eat candy and get headaches in the basement
I'm having a party
Hey, you wanna sleep over?
We're gonna play spin the bottle till it's time to go to bed

Bed time is quiet time
A time for lovers
You can share my sleeping bag

I'm having a party
Hey, you wanna sleep over?
We're gonna eat candy and get headaches in the basement
I'm having a party
Hey, you wanna sleep over?
We're gonna play spin the bottle till it's time to go to bed
