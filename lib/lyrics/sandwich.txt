Sandwich

As I lay this bread on the ground,
I know my job ain't done.
Leaves the earth all open-faced
And over exposed to the sun.

If the earth were a sandwich,
We'd get along so well.
We could feed everybody
With a piece of ourselves.

As I lay this bread on the ground,
I know my job ain't done.
If the earth were a sandwich,
We would all be one...
Sandwich.
